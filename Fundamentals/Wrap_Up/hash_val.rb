# Can hash values be arrays? Can you have an array of hashes? (give examples)

# Of course they can! here's an example of hash values as an array:

hash1 = {dogs: ["Zelda", "Leia", "Scout"], ages: [4, 2, 1]}

# and here's an example of an array of hashes:

array1 = [{lunch: "turkey sandwich"}, {dinner: "chicken and rice"}]

p hash1 
p array1
