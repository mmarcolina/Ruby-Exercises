# Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.

# from the limited amount of research I was able to gather on the topic, I feel as if the CRuby (or 'contributing to Ruby') resource is one of the most
# valuable, because it promotes feedback from end-users and programmers to collaborate in the open-source environment, allowing bugs to be fixed and
# potential changes to be discussed.
