x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

# What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

# Answer: my_hash creates a symbol using x as a key with a value of "some value", while my_hash2 uses the value assigned to the x variable
# as the key for the hash.
